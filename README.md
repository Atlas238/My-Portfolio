# Portfolio-one

 A dynamic and responsive portfolio page containing an about me, profile, my work and contact me sections

- Header contains a nav bar with links to each of the three main sections
- About me text and photo will scale to a breakpoint
- My work section contains 5 different tiles representing future projects, all currently containing empty links to be filled in later on
- Contact me email will create a blank template in users base email app, all other links are active

#### Issues I ran Into
- Sometimes tiles have lag if you move between them too quickly with the mouse (Animation stalls?)
- Formatting isn't great for small mobile devices and will have to remember to work small -> big for the next iteration
- Placeholder images are extremely large in some cases and provided for some interesting scaling behaviors
